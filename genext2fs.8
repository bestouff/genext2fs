.SH NAME
genext2fs \- ext2 filesystem generator for embedded systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B genext2fs
.RI [ options ]  " image"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgenext2fs\fP generates an ext2 filesystem
as a normal (non-root) user. It doesn't require you to mount
the image file to copy files on it. It doesn't even require
you to be the superuser to make device nodes.
.SH WARNING
\fBgenext2fs\fP has been designed for embedded
systems. As such, it will generate a filesystem for single-user
usage: all files/directories/etc... will belong to UID/GID 0
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -x \ image
Use this image as a starting point
.TP
.BI -d \ directory
Add this directory as source
.TP
.BI -f \ file
Add nodes (e.g. devices) from this spec file
.TP
.BI -b \ blocks
Size in blocks
.TP
.BI -i \ inodes
Number of inodes
.TP
.BI -r \ reserved
Number of reserved blocks
.TP
.BI -g \ path
Generate a block map file for this path
.TP
.BI -e \ value
Fill unallocated blocks with value
.TP
.BI -z
Make files with holes
.TP
.BI -v
Print resulting filesystem structure
.TP
.BI -h
Display help

.SH EXAMPLES

.EX
.B
 genext2fs -b 1440 -d src /dev/fd0
.EE

All files in the 
.I src
directory will be written to 
.B /dev/fd0
as a new ext2 filesystem image. You can then mount the floppy as
usual.

.EX
.B
 genext2fs -b 1024 -d src -f dev.txt flashdisk.img
.EE

This example builds a filesystem from all the files in 
.I src
, then device nodes are created based on the contents of the device file
.I dev.txt.
An example device file follows:

.EX
 drwx            /dev
 crw-    10,190  /dev/lcd
 brw-    1,0     /dev/ram0
.EE

This device list builds the /dev directory, a character device
node /dev/lcd (major 10, minor 190) and a block device node
/dev/ram0 (major 1, minor 0)
